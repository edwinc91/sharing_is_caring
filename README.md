# sharing_is_caring

<h4> Description </h4>
This is a light app that was created to give people a place to share their thoughts, what they've seen, what they've experienced anonymously
to other people where in turn, others can also react and comment to these "shares" anonymously. Sometimes, it just helps to write things out
and vent/share to others, regardless if you know them or not. 

<h4>Technology Used: </h4>
The app itself was made using NodeJS, AngularJS, and MaterializeCSS.

<h4>Future Work: </h4>
I want to possibly add users, so that people have the choice to post anonymously or not. Also, I am still deciding on if I want alternating colors
between posts, to further differentiate them.

Additionally, since I still haven't added users, I just allowed anyone to have access to deleting, and editting posts. Obviously, in an
actual app, this would cause some problems. Later on, I'm not sure whether I want to take away the feature where anyone can just post 
without signing in or making an account. If I don't take that feature away, I'll have to probably have the anonymous posts undeletable and 
uneditable, while having logged-in posts deletable/editable. Possibly for anonymous posts, I'll create an upvote/downvote feature where 
after a certain negative threshold, the post will be automatically deleted.
