# sharing_is_caring

<h4> Description </h4>
This is a light app that was created to give people a place to share their thoughts, what they've seen, what they've experienced anonymously
to other people where in turn, others can also react and comment to these "shares" anonymously. Sometimes, it just helps to write things out
and vent/share to others, regardless if you know them or not. 

<h4>Technology Used: </h4>
The app itself was made using NodeJS, AngularJS, and MaterializeCSS.

<h4>Future Work: </h4>
I want to possibly add users, so that people have the choice to post anonymously or not. Also, I am still deciding on if I want alternating colors
between posts, to further differentiate them.
